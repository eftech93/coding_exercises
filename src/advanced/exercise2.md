You have to create an algorithm that find every single word in English within a N X N matrix, you can move to left, right, top, bottom cell to form a word. Cannot repeat a cell though.

A B C B
S R A T
T A T A
D E R T

EX :
C -> A -> T = cat
T -> A -> T -> A -> R = tatar

Using the previous matriz we can find:

CAT
CAR
BRAT
BRA
AS
RAT
STAR
TATAR
.....
